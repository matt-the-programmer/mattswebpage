<h2>About Me</h2>

<p>

    I am originally from Maryborough on the Fraser Coast.
    I have moved to North Brisbane to continue my studies. 
    I enjoy playing video games, I'm a HUGE Fallout fan.
    Also I enjoy getting outdoors whenever I can, I have 
    been living at the Sunshine Coast for the last 6 months
    and have enjoyed spending lots of time at the beach.
    I also enjoy spending lots of time with my best friend
    Thor he's a border collie and I've added a photo of him
    on the page.
